### Added
- Enhanced Linux support with Wayland compatibility, multiple package formats (AppImage, deb, rpm, Flatpak), and native window controls
- Auto-detect existing Python during onboarding and gate the installer with a recheck option
- "Use Existing Python" skip flow to onboarding with confirmation dialog

### Changed

- Make Flatpak opt-in for local builds only

### CI/CD

- Add Linux packaging dependencies to GitHub Actions workflow

## [1.0.12] - 2025-11-13

### Added
- Added `scripts/complete-uninstall.sh` plus a new TROUBLESHOOTING guide so you can collect arch diagnostics, clean caches, and reset permissions before reinstalling stubborn builds.
- Control Panel history now auto-refreshes through a shared store and IPC events, so new, deleted, or cleared transcripts sync instantly without a manual refresh.
- Distribution artifacts now include both Apple Silicon and Intel macOS DMG/ZIP outputs, and the README documents Debian/Ubuntu packaging along with optional `xdotool` support.

### Changed
- The onboarding flow now validates dictation hotkeys before letting you continue, remembers whether cloud auth was skipped, and only persists sanitized API keys once supplied.
- History entries normalize timestamps and no longer run the removed legacy text cleanup helper, so the UI shows the exact Whisper output that was saved.

### Fixed
- Local Whisper now finds Python on Windows more reliably by scanning typical install paths, honoring `OPENWHISPR_PYTHON`, and surfacing actionable ENOENT guidance.
- Whisper installs automatically retry pip operations that hit PEP‑668, TOML, or permission errors, sanitizing the output and falling back to `--user` + legacy resolver when needed.

## [1.0.11] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- Settings, onboarding, and the AI model selector now accept OpenAI-compatible custom base URLs for both transcription and reasoning providers, complete with validation and reset helpers.
- Windows now gets full tray behavior: closing the control panel hides it to the tray, left-click reopens it, and the UI adds a native close button.

### Changed
- ReasoningService sends both `input` and `messages` payloads and automatically falls back between `/responses` and `/chat/completions` so older OpenAI-compatible endpoints keep working.

### Fixed
- Successful endpoint detection is cached per base URL, so the app remembers whether to call `/responses` or `/chat/completions` instead of retrying the wrong path forever.
- Custom endpoint fields now enforce HTTPS (with localhost as the lone exception) across the UI and services, preventing API keys from ever leaving over plain HTTP.

## [1.0.10] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- Added a `compile:globe` build step that emits a macOS Globe listener binary into `resources/bin` before every dev, pack, or dist command so the hotkey ships with all builds.

### Fixed
- Globe key failures now raise a macOS dialog, verify the bundled binary is executable, and kill/restart the listener cleanly so the shortcut survives packaging.

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-07

### Changed
- Simplified the release workflow by removing the bespoke GitHub release job and letting electron-builder upload draft releases directly.

## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- Globe/Fn hotkey reliability improved by showing the dictation panel before toggling, making focus optional, and surfacing listener spawn errors instead of failing silently.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Settings update controls now show download progress bars, install countdowns, and clearer messaging while fetching or installing new builds.

### Changed
- Auto-update internals now track listeners, cache the last release metadata, and keep auto-download/auto-install disabled until the user explicitly triggers an update, eliminating the previous memory leaks.

### Fixed
- `Install & Restart` now emits `before-quit`, enables `autoInstallOnAppQuit`, logs progress, and calls `quitAndInstall(false, true)` so updates actually apply when quitting or pressing the button.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-11

### Added
- **Dictation Panel Command Menu**: Clicking the floating panel reveals quick actions, including a one-click "Hide this for now" option.
- **macOS Globe Key Support**: Added a lightweight Swift listener so the Globe/Fn key can toggle dictation across the system.
- **Globe Key Selection UI**: Settings and onboarding keyboards now include a dedicated Globe key option.
- **Hotkey Validation**: Settings and onboarding now verify shortcut registration immediately, alerting users when a key can’t be bound.
- **Model Cache Cleanup**: Added an in-app command (and installer/uninstaller hooks) to delete all cached Whisper models.
- **Tray Controls**: macOS tray menu gained quick actions to show or hide the dictation panel.

### Changed
- **Dictation Overlay Placement**: Window now anchors to the active workspace's bottom-right corner with a safety margin, preventing it from sliding off-screen on multi-monitor setups.
- **Dictation Overlay Canvas**: Enlarged the floating window so tooltips, menus, and error states render without being clipped while keeping click-through behaviour outside interactive elements.
- **Keyboard UX**: Virtual keyboard hides macOS-exclusive keys on Windows/Linux and standardises hotkey labels.

### Fixed
- **macOS Window Lifecycle**: Ensured the dictation panel keeps the app visible in Dock and Command-Tab while retaining floating behaviour across spaces.
- **Control Panel Stability**: Reworked close/minimize handling so the panel stays interactive when switching apps and reopens cleanly without spawning duplicate windows.
- **Always-On-Top Enforcement**: Centralised the logic that reapplies floating window levels, eliminating redundant timers and focus quirks.
- **Menu Labelling**: macOS application menu items now display the correct OpenWhispr casing instead of "open-whispr".
- **Non-mac Hotkey Guard**: Prevented the mac-only Globe shortcut from being saved on Windows/Linux.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-10

  - Added `npmRebuild: true` to force rebuild of native modules during packaging
